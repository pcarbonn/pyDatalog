"""
This console application lets you enter pyDatalog clauses and facts, 
and query the datalog database directly.  (To experiment with the python API,
please use the python console/IDLE instead)

Sample session:
    pyDatalog> +p(a)
    pyDatalog> ask(p(X))
    [('a',)]
    pyDatalog> exit()
