"""
This file shows how to use pyDatalog using facts stored in a relational database, 
via SQLAlchemy's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).

It has 4 parts :
    1. initialize the ORM
    2. define python class and business rules 
    3. create table and rows for 2 employees
    4. Query the objects using the datalog engine
